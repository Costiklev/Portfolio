            <p>Hi! I’m Costantino, aka Costiklev.</p>
            <p>I’m a self-taught Italian programmer and game developer who’s been making games for over 6 years and I’ve always loved doing it. Even when I was just 7, I was already telling people I wanted to make video games one day.</p>
            <p>Today, I mainly work with Unity and I’m constantly trying out new tools, languages, and ideas to improve wherever I can.</p>
            <p>I love turning ideas into something real, whether it's a game, a tool, or an automation bot that makes life easier.</p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>My game dev journey started with <strong>GameMaker</strong>, where I built my first ever project; a messy little platformer with spike traps, falling dripstone, and bottomless pits. It was buggy, clunky, and ugly, but it was the beginning of something huge in my life.</p>
            <p>Not long after, I made a second GameMaker project that was honestly kind of fun. It had hilariously bad textures, but the gameplay held up. Blocks would fall from the top of the screen, and you had to avoid them, it was <strong>chaotic</strong>, <strong>fast paced</strong>, but most importantly, <strong>fun</strong>. What really surprised me was that I managed to implement a <strong>dynamic difficulty system</strong> that ramped up over time. That was way beyond what I expected myself to pull off back then. I still have that project, and if you’re interested you can find it on my Projects page or you can just click <a href="projects.html#FBSection" class = "neon" title="GameMaker project">here</a>.</p>
            <p>What’s special about how I started, though, is that I wasn’t following YouTube tutorials or reading guides. I actually got into programming thanks to someone I met on Discord, a random internet stranger who turned out to be one of the most helpful people I’ve ever met. He spent weeks teaching me the basics of <strong>GML</strong> and <strong>GameMaker</strong> through voice calls and chats. Without him, I probably wouldn’t have made it past the “I want to make games” phase. I owe a huge part of my journey to his patience and guidance.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I tried switching to <strong>Unity</strong>. Twice, actually. The first time, I opened the engine and instantly noped out , it was overwhelming and felt like I was in way over my head. I went back to GameMaker for a while. But the second time I gave Unity a shot, something clicked. I started understanding how it worked, and little by little, I found myself building full projects with it.</p>
            <p>Since then, Unity has been my main engine. <strong>I've created over 10 projects using it</strong>, some small experiments, some big ideas, <strong>some published</strong>, some scrapped. I don’t really like calling projects “failures”. If I drop something halfway through, I treat it as a lesson. Some games didn’t work out because of scope creep, some because of weak game design, and others because I got too perfectionist. But <strong>each one taught me something</strong>, and I carry those lessons into every new project.</p>
            <p>In <strong>2022</strong>, I published my first Unity game: <strong><a href="projects.html#LDSection" class = "neon" title="Lunar Dash">Lunar Dash</a></strong>, a 2D arcade-style runner. When I saw it on the play store for the first time the adrenaline rush was <strong>unreal</strong>. It hit me that this wasn’t just a hobby anymore , this was what I wanted to do with my life. A year later, I published <strong><a href="projects.html#DFFSection" class = "neon" title="Donut Fusion Frenzy">Donut Fusion Frenzy</a></strong>, a game inspired by Suika Game, and with it came more feedback, more improvements, and more growth.</p>
            <p>I’ve also explored beyond games, I’ve built <strong>automation bots in Python</strong> to handle repetitive tasks, dabbled in websites, and even played around with simpler engines like <strong>Scratch</strong> (which I learned in less than a day just for fun). But no matter what I build, games are always where my heart is.</p>

            <h2>My Toolset</h2>
            <p>My favorite language is <strong>C#</strong>, mostly because it’s the one I’ve spent the most time with, and it's <strong>really powerful</strong> when it comes to game development with Unity. That said, I have a lot of respect for <strong>Python</strong> too. It’s really <strong>intuitive</strong>, <strong>clean to write</strong>, and I picked it up in about a week. I’ve used it for things like <strong>automation bots</strong> and experimenting with <strong>AI training</strong>.</p>
            <p>I wouldn’t say I’ve “mastered” any language (that takes decades) but I’ve gotten pretty solid at a many game dev tools. As a solo developer, I’ve had to wear a lot of hats, so I learned how to handle more than just code: <strong>Unity and C#</strong> for all kinds of game projects, <strong>Blender</strong> for creating and editing 3D models, <strong>Krita</strong> for designing textures and pixel art, <strong>Audacity & jsfxr</strong> for basic sound design (though I’m definitely weakest in this area), <strong>OBS Studio</strong> for gameplay recording and content creation, and of course, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for building this very website</p>
            <p>Each language or tool serves a different purpose in my projects. <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>GML</strong> are my go-to for games, <strong>Python</strong> handles the bots and backend stuff, and <strong>JavaScript/CSS</strong> are perfect for bringing interactive elements to the web.</p>
            <p>Honestly, every project I make surprises me. It’s a weird but classic developer moment: you bang your head against the wall for hours wondering why something won’t work and when it finally does, you’re like, “wait... why is it working?” That moment never gets old.</p>
            <p>While I usually focus on <strong>gameplay mechanics and design</strong> , I’ve learned how to handle everything from <strong>programming to visuals</strong>. I can build <strong>shaders</strong>, apply <strong>post-processing</strong>, make my own textures, and even design <strong>UI/UX</strong> from scratch. Being a solo dev taught me how to do it all or at least fake it till I make it.</p>
            <p>I’m not the kind of person who jumps to every new shiny tool that drops, I like sticking to what works. But if something new solves a real problem, I’m all in. Right now, I’m focused on getting deeper into <strong>AI</strong>, and, for fun, I’ve started messing around with the programming language <strong>Brainfuck</strong>, just to see if I can bend my brain a little more.</p>
            <p>If you want to see a full breakdown of everything I use: languages, engines, tools, and what I built with them <a href="skills.html" class = "neon" title="Skills Page">check out my full skills page</a></p>

            <h2>Outside of Programming</h2>
            <p>Programming might be a huge part of my life, but it’s definitely not the only thing that defines me.</p>
            <p>I <strong>train at the gym regularly</strong>, partly because I want to stay healthy, but also because it builds <strong>discipline</strong> and <strong>strength</strong> which have helped me a lot, not just in fitness but in coding and life in general. That said, if I had to pick between gym and cycling, I’d probably hop on my bike. <strong>Cycling</strong> lets me reach parks or <strong>explore</strong> further from home, and it’s how I get to the spot where I do <strong>calisthenics</strong> or just <strong>hang out</strong> and <strong>relax with friends</strong>.</p>
            <p>Another thing I’ve been picking up lately is <strong>playing guitar</strong>. I started just a few months ago, and I’m currently learning <strong>pop-rock</strong> and <strong>LoFi</strong> songs, mostly from indie artists like <strong>BoyWithUke and Marino</strong>. It’s still new territory for me, but it’s been a fun and calming way to balance all the technical stuff I usually do.</p>
            <p>One of the more unique things I’m into is <strong>urbex</strong>, short for <strong>urban exploration</strong>. I got into it earlier this summer with a group of friends who’d been doing it for a while. It’s not about breaking rules, we explore safe, abandoned places that are tucked away and forgotten.
What I love is the <strong>feeling</strong>: the silence, the sense of mystery, and that odd peacefulness you get when you're standing in a place time left behind. For a moment, it feels like you’re outside the normal world, and that’s something I really enjoy.</p>
            <p>When I’m working on anything, whether it’s code, guitar, or chilling after a ride, I always have <strong>music playing</strong>. My go-to is <strong>House Phonk</strong>, which somehow makes me feel relaxed and focused at the same time. But I’ve got love for <strong>pop</strong>, <strong>rock</strong>, <strong>LoFi</strong>, <strong>funk</strong>, and pretty much anything with a good vibe.</p>
            <p>Another big part of my life has always been <strong>video games</strong>. I’ve been playing <strong>Minecraft</strong> since I was 6 or 7, and I’ve never really stopped. Its sandbox style and endless creativity shaped how I think and build, both in games and in real life. 
                It’s also where I got my first taste of <strong>programming/modding with MCreator</strong> and experimenting with datapacks by hand. Another game that left a huge impact on me, even if I didn’t play it as much, is <strong>Hollow Knight</strong>. I spent around 70 hours on it, and it stuck with me because of its fluid combat, incredible atmosphere, and emotional storytelling. 
                At one point, I also got really into the lore of <strong>Five Nights at Freddy’s</strong>, more as a mystery to unravel than a game to play. These days, I’ve shifted toward FPS games like <strong>Apex Legends and Valorant</strong>, but I carry a bit of everything I’ve experienced into the way I design and think about games now.</p>
            <p>Right now, I’m also working toward a big personal goal: <strong>getting my first motorcycle</strong>. Not because I want to go fast, but because it gives me something I deeply value, <strong>freedom</strong>. I live in a place where everything fun or interesting is several kilometers away, and being able to move around on my own terms would completely change how I live. I don’t have one specific bike I’m chasing, I just keep an eye on second-hand listings, and the <strong>Kawasaki Z</strong> series has been one of the best options so far. It’s not an easy goal, but it gives me something to aim at. And when I get there, I’ll know <strong>I can reach any other goal I set</strong>, no matter how difficult it is. </p>
