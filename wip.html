            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Currently my main goal is finishing this portfolio. I've been making it for about 2 weeks and now it's almost ready. The only remaining changes are adding new apps into the projects page, and polishing a few other pages.</p>

            <h2>Cel Shaded Shader</h2>
            <p>As a freelancing gig I have to make a toon shader, with cell shading, an outline, and material maps support. My goal is finishing this project in a week. I've already finished the shader in UNity, but now have to recreate it in Godot, an engine I've never used before.</p>
